Generate memorable identifiers by combining adjectives with Pokémon names. Inspired by codename-style ID generators, this package creates unique and fun labels for objects, files, or projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `dexid` from GitHub with:

``` r
pak::pak("schochastics/dexid")
```

## Example

The main function `dexid()` generates random identifiers by combining adjectives with Pokémon names. By default, it generates identifiers in `snake_case`, but you can customize the case style, number of used adjectives, and whether to add random digits.

```{r example}
library(dexid)
set.seed(1234)

# Generate 5 basic snake_case IDs
dexid(5)

# Generate 5 IDs with 2 adjectives for more uniqueness
dexid(5, n_adj = 2)

# Generate 5 Title Case IDs
dexid(5, case = "title")

# Generate 5 IDs with random digits
dexid(5, add_digits = TRUE)

# Generate 5 IDs restrict to specific generation(s)
dexid(5, gen = 1)
```

The package includes `r length(dexid:::adjectives)` adjectives and `r length(dexid:::pokemon)` Pokémon names, allowing for `r format(length(dexid:::adjectives) * length(dexid:::pokemon),big.mark = ",")` unique combinations with one adjective and `r format(length(dexid:::adjectives)^2 * length(dexid:::pokemon),big.mark = ",")` unique combinations with two adjectives.

## Sentences

The function `dex_sentence()` generates random sentence of Pokémon using a specific move that can be used as an identifier.
```{r}
dex_sentence(5)
```
